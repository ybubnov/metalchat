Installation
============

The project is distributed as both a Framework, and a binary utility to run the model inference.
Currently, the installation implies compilation from sources using `Homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`_
package manager.

In order to install both Framework and binary, add a
`third-party repository <https://docs.brew.sh/Taps>`_:

.. code:: console

   $ brew tap ybubnov/metalchat https://github.com/ybubnov/metalchat

Then install the latest version of the project:

.. code:: console

   $ brew install --HEAD metalchat

   See more details on downloading and running a Llama3 model
   in the :doc:`command line guide <command_line>`.
